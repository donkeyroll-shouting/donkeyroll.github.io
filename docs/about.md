# About

This site is used to post personal blogs including technical learnings, works, sports, everything about my life.

# Me

I am a Software Engineer and usually write codes with **Golang** in my daily work. I'm also familiar with **Java**, **Python** and **C**. 

Besides, I am also

- An interviewer and love algorithm coding questions. Codeforce is too hard for me.
- Working with a bunch of Kubernetes founder-level contributers but still learning **Kubernetes** QAQ.
- An amateur soccer player. My favorite player is **Miroslav Klose**.
- A rookie learner of game development with **Unity**.
